# SEDfitting_code_comparison
Comparing Stellar Mass, SFR, Dust, and other outputs from SED fitting codes run on a subset of CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies. A direct result of efforts that started at the CANDELS workshop at UC Riverside, April 10-13, 2018.

## Current codes being compared are: [Add references/links]
- Beagle
- Prospector
- Bagpipes
- Interrogator
- Pacifici+16
- Dense Basis SED fitting
- Salmon+15 / FITSED
- Nima (what name should I use?)
- Marianna (what name should I use?)
- Cigale
- LePhare
- SpeedyMC
- EAZY
- Magphys
- SED3FIT

The current status of the outputs from each code can be found [here](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5ad4ea1b957571b6c4c77332/5b1014a5a8ba88aad69edba9/938972837116cd8c5e47e89bea9a4443/code_output_status_05_31_18.PNG).
